              <p>I built a Mindfulness Meditation app using HTML,CSS,JavaScript. Firebase was used for Authentication and Database Storage. Phonegap
                was used to rebuild the HTML,CSS and Javascript into an Android Application that can be installed on the Android Platform Via APK.
                The Application features Video and Audio Meditations based on topics the user chooses. The User chooses a topic and meditations are loaded for
                them to enjoy. There is a page for Journalling that allows users to post their thoughts. Essentially a Diary.
